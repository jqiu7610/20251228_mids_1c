# Grouped data

We've just discussed approaches to make visual comparisons between groups. The approach we want to use depends on what particular comparisons we want to make between the groups, how many groups we have to compare, and even differences in the scales of these two groups.

Now, we'll practice both approaches we covered with the `nyc_squirrels` dataset.

# Coding task 

- Navigate to the [Datahub](https://ischool.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FUCB-MIDS%2Fr_bridge&urlpath=rstudio%2F&branch=master) and open the code `grouped_data.Rmd`. 
- This code will ask you to plot grouped data two different ways:
  - Once using multiple series on the same plot
  - Once using `facet_wrap()` to plot each series on its own plot
